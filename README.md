AudioController
===============
This is the code behind my app which can be found on the Pi Store: http://store.raspberrypi.com/projects/raspberry-pi-audio-control .
Run the install script (thisis needed to install tkinter which I use for my GUI): 'sh install.sh'.
Run the application: 'python run.py'.
Uninstall tkinter: 'sh uninstall.sh'
Delete the application: 'rm run.py' from the /AudioController folder or 'rm -r /AudioController' if you are outside of the folder.

Please use this in any audio program or operating system. Feel free to mpdify, add to and change this. Something like this is soon to be added to Sonic Pi, and I hope to raspbian too.
